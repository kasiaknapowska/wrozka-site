## About Gatsby

### What's inside?

1. The  **`/src`** directory contains all of the code related to what is seen on the front-end of the site (in the browser) such as pages files and building blocks (components). It also contains icons and images added to data layer powered by GraphQL.

2.  The **`gatsby-config.js`** is the configuration file for a Gatsby site, where site metadata and Gatsby plugins are specified (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

### How to develop?
1. Fork and clone this repository
2. In the project directory install dependencies - npm install
3. Run the app in development mode - gatsby develop
4. The site is running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   Note: There is also a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool for experimenting with querying data. More information about using this tool you'll find in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).
